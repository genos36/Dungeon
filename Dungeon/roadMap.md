## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

Step 1.1: Basic Texture Loader (Singleton)
Step 1.2: Texture Enum System
Step 1.3: Simple Sprite Rendering
Step 1.4: Basic Tile Drawing

## Phase 2: Core System (Week 2-3)

Step 2.1: Layered Rendering System
Step 2.2: Entity Rendering Component
Step 2.3: Camera/View System
Step 2.4: Batch Rendering for Tiles
    Step 2.4.1: Complete BatchRenderer (you already have the foundation)
    Step 2.4.2: Create BatchRenderLayerSystem that contains BatchRenderer

## Phase 3: Optimization (Week 4)

Step 3.1: Sprite Batching
Step 3.2: Render Culling
-------------------------------
Step 3.2: Texture Atlas Generation
    Step 3.2.1 enhance Render component to add support for texture atlas
    Step 3.2.2 implement Texture altlas
    Step 3.2.3 implement Texture atlas loader
    Step 3.2.4 implement texture atlas registry
    Step 3.2.5 (still in review) add some system to combine single texture in a texture atlas , it's still to decide if create a dynamic texture atlas or adding a script to combine them once so it will require more configuration but will have a better run time performance  
Step 3.4: Level of Detail (LOD)

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)

Step 4.1: Animation System
Step 4.2: Particle Effects
Step 4.3: Lighting System
Step 4.4: Post-processing Effects
